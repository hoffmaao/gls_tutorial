function out = fabricGLS(obs, z, opts)
%FABRICGLS Generalized least squares inversion of the Fujita model, with uncertainty.
%
% out = ptt.fabricGLS(obs, z, opts)
%
% Estimates the fabric orientation theta(z), the horizontal eigenvalue
% difference dlam(z) and the anisotropic scattering ratio r(z) as DEPTH
% PROFILES, by generalized least squares against the full layered
% Fujita et al. (2006) forward model (ptt.fujitaModel), and returns a
% posterior covariance rather than a point estimate alone.
%
% WHAT THIS CHANGES RELATIVE TO ptt.polarimetricRatioInverse AND
% ptt.polarimetricInverse. Both of those impose theta(z) = theta0 as a
% HARD constraint, which is what buys their analytic forward model. That
% is a strong assumption dressed as a method: where the axis does rotate -
% a shear margin, the deep part of an ice stream - they cannot say so,
% they can only fit badly. Here theta(z) is a free profile and the
% constant-orientation case is recovered by making its PRIOR tight. The
% assumption becomes a number the user sets and the data can argue with,
% and out.resolution says how much of each estimate came from the data
% rather than from that prior.
%
% THE FORMULATION. With d the observations, g(m) the forward model, C_d
% the data covariance and (m_prior, C_m) the prior:
%
%   L(m) = (d - g(m))' inv(C_d) (d - g(m)) + (m - m_p)' inv(C_m) (m - m_p)
%
% minimised by iterative linearisation (Tarantola). At each step, with G
% the Jacobian of g at the current m,
%
%   dm   = (G' inv(C_d) G + inv(C_m))^-1 [G' inv(C_d) (d - g(m)) - inv(C_m)(m - m_p)]
%   C_M  = (G' inv(C_d) G + inv(C_m))^-1                    posterior covariance
%   R    = C_M G' inv(C_d) G                                resolution
%
% C_M is the linearised (Gaussian) posterior at the solution. Its diagonal
% gives the one-sigma uncertainty on every parameter, propagated to depth
% profiles in out.sigma_*. R is the resolution matrix: a diagonal entry
% near 1 means the data determined that parameter, near 0 means the prior
% did, and reporting an estimate whose resolution is near zero as a
% measurement is the main way this kind of inversion misleads.
%
% WHY GENERALIZED AND NOT ORDINARY LEAST SQUARES. The observables are not
% on one scale and are not equally certain. A dB power anomaly from N
% looks has variance (10/ln10)^2 psi'(N); a coherence phase from the same
% looks has variance (1-|C|^2)/(2 N |C|^2), which varies by orders of
% magnitude down a column as the coherence decays. Ordinary least squares
% would weight a decohered deep phase sample as heavily as a clean shallow
% one. C_d is where that belongs - and it also removes the arbitrary
% observable weight that ptt.polarimetricRatioInverse has to tune by hand
% (its w_phi, fixed at 2 dB per radian by experiment rather than by
% measurement uncertainty).
%
% CORRELATED ERRORS, HANDLED HONESTLY. Neighbouring depth samples are not
% independent: range multilooking correlates them, and so does the
% coherence window. This code does NOT build a full banded C_d; it takes
% an EFFECTIVE look count (opts.n_looks, the number of INDEPENDENT looks)
% and forms a diagonal C_d from it. That is the right first-order fix,
% because the failure mode of ignoring correlation is a posterior that is
% too tight by roughly the square root of the correlation length in
% samples, and inflating the variance corrects the size even though it
% does not capture the shape. The posterior is therefore CHECKED against
% Monte Carlo scatter in test_fabric_gls rather than trusted; a linearised
% posterior on a problem this non-linear can be optimistic no matter how
% carefully C_d is built.

% --- data vector and its covariance (diagonal, from the look count)
% REDUNDANCY. A diagonal C_d is right only if the samples are independent,
% and the expectation here was that they are not: synthesized azimuths are
% linear combinations of the SAME four measured channels, so Np azimuth
% columns should carry about four independent numbers rather than Np, and a
% diagonal C_d counting each repeat as fresh evidence should come out too
% tight. opts.n_indep_psi was added to correct that.
%
% VERDICT 5 OF test_fabric_gls MEASURED THE OPPOSITE, and the option
% therefore stays OFF. Under noise confined to a rank-4 azimuthal subspace
% the diagonal posterior is not optimistic at all - the reported/empirical
% ratio comes out near 1.15, i.e. mildly CONSERVATIVE - while n_indep_psi =
% 4 multiplies every sigma by sqrt(Np/4) (2.1x at the default 18 azimuths)
% and overshoots to about 2.4. Azimuth redundancy is simply not what
% threatens these error bars. Do not turn n_indep_psi on for
% channel-synthesized azimuths; verdict 5 exists to record the measurement
% that stops exactly that reflex, and it prints both ratios every run.
%
% The option is kept, and documented, for data that genuinely does repeat
% samples. Rather than build a dense C_d for a matrix this large, the
% variances are inflated by the redundancy ratio, which is exactly
% equivalent for the posterior scale: set n_indep_psi to the number of
% INDEPENDENT azimuths and n_indep_z to the number of independent depth
% samples. Defaults assume independence, so an unset option never silently
% inflates anything.
%
% This is a SEPARATE question from how far the posterior can be trusted at
