function out = quadpolFabricLS(S, z, opts)
%QUADPOLFABRICLS Fabric from a local least-squares fit of the coherence field.
%
% out = ptt.quadpolFabricLS(S, z, opts)
%
% Fits the measured complex HH-VV coherence C(psi, z), over ALL synthetic
% azimuths at once, to the exact single-column birefringence model in a
% sliding depth window. Three physical parameters per window - the axis
% azimuth theta0, the accumulated two-way phase delta0 at the window
% centre, and its local rate ddelta/dz - plus linear nuisances: a scale
% gamma for the coherence floor, and a three-component antenna-frame
% PEDESTAL (see below). dlam is ddelta/dz converted by the same constant
% ptt.quadpolFabric uses.
%
% WHY THIS EXISTS. ptt.ershadiFabric follows the published chain and takes
% the fabric axis from the cross-polarized power minimum. On this system
% the cross-polarized channels sit on a flat instrument pedestal (cross/co
% ~ -3.6 dB with 0.35 dB of depth ripple, where fabric cross-pol must null
% through every delta = 2*pi*m), so that minimum is antenna-locked: 89.6
% +- 1.9 deg across 1790 blocks spanning all headings. This estimator
% takes theta0 from the SHAPE of the coherence field instead, which the
% co-polarized channels dominate, and models rather than gates the
% coherence structure the fabric itself creates.
%
% THE MODEL. For a column with principal axes at theta0 and accumulated
% two-way eigenmode phase difference delta(z), the deterministic coherence
% at synthetic azimuth psi is, with mu = cos 2(psi - theta0),
%
%   num = (1-mu^2)/2 + ((1+mu^2)/2) cos delta + i mu sin delta
%   den = 1 - ((1-mu^2)/2) (1 - cos delta)        (= |hh|^2 = |vv|^2)
%   C_model = gamma * num / den + pedestal(psi)
%
% within a window delta(z) = delta0 + ddelta*(z - zc).
%
% THE PEDESTAL. A reciprocal antenna-fixed cross-pol term L carried
% through the synthesis adds 2cs(<L F*> - <F L*>) to <T_hh T_vv*> - an
% odd, complex sin(2psi) term - and -4c^2s^2 <|L|^2>, an even real
% sin^2(2psi) dip. Measured directly on frame 009: at every even-2pi
% crossing, where the fabric's own signature vanishes, the coherence
% field collapses to exactly this shape (DC 0.09, 4psi harmonic 0.16-0.20)
% while the on-axis phase gradient stays clean - and the |H| = 1 fabric
% model, unable to represent it, doubled ddelta there ("regular jumps").
% So the model carries pedestal(psi) = (a1 + i a2) sin 2psi + a3 sin^2
% 2psi; all three enter linearly and are solved jointly with gamma in
% closed form at every grid node.
%
% WHY THE PEDESTAL IS ESTIMATED PER FRAME, NOT PER WINDOW. Within one
% window the pedestal coefficients are depth-constant - and so is the
% leading fabric phasor when the window sits at small ddelta*L, so for a
% fabric axis near 45 deg to the antenna axes (where mu = sin 2psi and
% the two azimuthal shapes coincide) the two are confounded per window:
% measured 2.4x inflation of the window dlam error at d = 45 vs d = 15 on
% synthetics. Across the COLUMN they are orthogonal at every theta0: the
% pedestal is an instrument constant while the fabric coefficients sweep
% sin/cos of delta0 through many fringes, averaging to zero. Default mode
% 'frame' therefore runs two passes: pedestal free per window, then the
% robust frame-level median subtracted and each window refit with only a
% strongly-ridged DEVIATION from it (anchored, not pinned - see
% H_fit_windows for why hard pinning was worse). The fitted frame
% pedestal is returned in out.pedestal: a per-frame CALIBRATION
% MEASUREMENT of the same term that antenna-locks the published chain.
%
% AMBIGUITY AND SIGN. (theta0 + 90, -delta0, -ddelta) produces the same
% field, so ddelta >= 0 is enforced and theta0 is unique modulo 180: it is
% the axis along which the (deramped) phase difference grows with depth,
% the same convention ershadiFabric reaches through the polarity of Psi.
% An isotropic window has ddelta = 0 INSIDE the parameter space, so noise
% averages to zero instead of folding to a positive floor the way |Psi|
% does.
%
% TWO-PASS USE ACROSS BLOCKS. theta0 and the pedestal vary slowly (or not
% at all) along track, so estimate both once per frame, then pass them
% back in for the per-block section (opts.theta0 and opts.pedestal set):
% the block fits then have two free physical parameters, no
% block-to-block axis jitter, and a consistent calibration.

% --- CONSTANT-ORIENTATION MODE. One theta0 for the whole column instead of
% one per window: the windows vote by their own theta cost curves, which the
% grid search already computed, and the winner is refit into every window.
%
% WHY IT IS OFTEN THE BETTER MODEL. Per-window theta0 spends one free
% parameter per window on a quantity that at a divide does not vary: Ridge
% A's frame axis is 96.5 +- 7.4 deg across 36 frames, while its per-window
% scatter within a frame is ~13 deg - i.e. most of that scatter is
% estimation noise, not ice. Removing those degrees of freedom leaves the
% depth-varying quantity that IS physical (delta0 and its gradient, hence
% dlam) better determined, and hands downstream steps an axis stable enough
% to condition on.
%
% WEIGHTING. Each window's curve is NORMALISED by its own data power
% (theta_c2) before the sum, i.e. pooled on the q_theta scale, so a window
% votes in proportion to how sharply ITS curve is peaked and nothing else.
% Raw-cost pooling was tried first and is wrong on real data: the data
% power - the CRB-weighted coherence power - runs 100-1000x higher in the
% near-surface windows than at depth, and on Ridge A frame 009 seven
% windows at 57-147 m carried 86% of the raw vote and put the axis at 102
% deg while every window from 200 m to the bottom sat at 93-96 deg (the
% frame's published value). Those surface windows are exactly where the
% co-pol reference offset makes the model untrustworthy, and a raw sum
% lets them outvote the whole column. Normalised, the vote lands on 96
% with or without any depth cut, so no site-specific depth enters here.
% A flat curve still carries nothing - its normalised range is small - and
% windows flat within pool_q_min of their own power are excluded outright.
%
% WHEN NOT TO USE IT. It is a MODEL ASSUMPTION, not a refinement: where the
% axis genuinely rotates with depth - Thwaites' margin, EastGRIP - it will
% return some average of the rotation and the per-window residuals will say
% so. Check out.theta_const_q (the pooled contrast) and the residual
