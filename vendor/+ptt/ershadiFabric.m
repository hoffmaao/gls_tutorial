% Ershadi, M. R., Drews, R., Martin, C., Eisen, O., Ritz, C., Corr, H.,
% Christmann, J., Zeising, O., Humbert, A. and Mulvaney, R. (2022),
% "Polarimetric radar reveals the spatial distribution of ice fabric at
% domes and divides in East Antarctica", The Cryosphere 16, 1719-1739.
%
% A faithful implementation of the published chain, kept SEPARATE from
% ptt.quadpolFabric so the two can be run on the same data and compared.
% Where this file departs from that one it is because the paper does, and
% each departure is marked (E1)-(E5) below.
%
%   (E1) SYNTHESIS SENSE. Their eq. (11) is
%          S_N(theta +- gamma) = R(theta +- gamma) S_N(theta) R'(...)
%        i.e. R S R'. ptt.rotatePolarization applies R' S R, the inverse
%        rotation, so the two recover orientations of opposite sign
%        (theta -> -theta, which for a modulo-180 axis is 180 - theta).
%        This follows the paper.
%
%   (E2) DERAMPING. "The deramping corresponds to a complex conjugation of
%        C_HHVV", so the paper uses eq. (7) for models and its CONJUGATE
%        for radar data. That flips the sign of phi_HHVV, hence of Psi and
%        of the branch that decides which axis carries lam_max. Controlled
%        by opts.deramped, default true for real data.
%
%   (E3) UNWRAP-FREE GRADIENT. They follow Jordan et al. (2019) and take a
%        1D convolutional derivative of the real and imaginary parts of the
%        COMPLEX coherence, never of the phase:
%          dphi/dz = Im(conj(C) dC/dz) / |C|^2
%        This is not a refinement, it removes a failure mode: differencing
%        an unwrapped phase inherits every cycle slip, and unwrapping is
%        what produced three separate branch-cut bugs in quadpolFabric.
%
%   (E4) ORIENTATION FROM THE POWER ANOMALY. Their eq. (12) works in dB
%        against the azimuthal mean,
%          dP_xx(theta,z) = 20 log10( |s_xx| / mean_b |s_xx(theta_b)| )
%        and orientation is the MINIMUM of dP_HV (cross-polarization
%        extinction), disambiguated by the polarity of phi_HHVV.
%
%   (E5) QUALITY GATE. "We restrict the analysis to the top 2000 m, where
%        typically |C_HHVV| > 0.4."
%
% CONSTANT. Their eq. (9) as printed reads Psi = 2 c eps' /(4 pi fc
% Deps') dphi/dz. Deriving it: the two-way phase difference accumulates at
% dphi/dz = 2 (2 pi fc/c) Dn with Dn = Deps' dlam / (2 sqrt(eps')), giving
%   dlam = c sqrt(eps') / (2 pi fc Deps') dphi/dz,
% i.e. sqrt(eps'), not eps'. The two differ by a factor sqrt(3.15) = 1.77.
% The square-root form is used here because it is what the physics gives,
% because it agrees to 0.7% with this repo's independent calibration of
% ptt.twttDifference (fringe_check.m), and because a 1.77x error would
% have been obvious against the ice cores the paper validates on - so the
% printed form is most likely a typesetting loss of the radical.
%
% Inputs
%   S     struct of complex [Nt x Nx] channels hh, vv, hv (vh optional)
%   z     [Nt x 1] depth of each row [m]
%   opts  fc (750e6), psi_step_deg (1), win_m (coherence window, 30),
%         grad_win_m (Gaussian sigma for the gradient, 25),
%         coh_min (0.4), deramped (true)
%
% Output fields: psi, dP_hh, dP_hv, phi, Cmag, psi_grad, dlam, theta,
%   theta_quality, plus the constants this call ran under - coh_min,
%   deramped, fc, eps_perp, deps, win_m. The last four are RECORDED rather
%   than merely defaulted because dlam is derived from them (eq. 9): any
%   downstream step that accepts dlam without re-fitting it, such as
%   ptt.ershadiInverse, has to propagate phase under the same constants,
%   and a mismatch there is a silent rescale with nothing to reveal it.
