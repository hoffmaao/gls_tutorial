%BIREFRINGENTPHASERATE One-way relative phase per metre per unit dlam.
%
% gpd1 = ptt.birefringentPhaseRate(fc, eps_perp, deps)
%
% The x-vs-y phase a birefringent layer accumulates in ONE pass, per metre
% and per unit horizontal eigenvalue difference dlam:
%
%   gpd1 = pi * fc * Deps' / (sqrt(eps') * c)
%
% from Dn = Deps' dlam / (2 sqrt(eps')) and a one-way phase 2 pi fc Dn / c.
% A down-and-up sandwich doubles it, which is the two-way gradient
% ptt.ershadiFabric inverts in its eq. (9)/(10) step - the two are exact
% reciprocals of one another, so they must be computed from the same
% constants or a retrieval and the model it is compared against land on
% different depths.
%
% SINGLE OWNER. ptt.fujitaModel propagates phase with this, and
% ptt.ershadiInverse locates the anti-phase depths for its eq. (13)
% cross-check with it. Those two must agree exactly or the cross-check is
% evaluated at depths the model never puts a node at, which is the same
% class of silent desync that ptt.ershadiInverse's H_const guards for
% fc/eps_perp/deps themselves - so the constant they feed lives here rather
% than being written out at each call site.
%
% Inputs
%   fc        centre frequency (Hz)
%   eps_perp  perpendicular permittivity (the paper's 3.15, not eps_bar)
%   deps      dielectric anisotropy (ptt.constants deps, 0.034)
%
% See also ptt.fujitaModel, ptt.ershadiInverse, ptt.ershadiFabric.

% Three positional scalars of the same type invite a transposed call, and a
% transposed call here is silent - it returns a plausible number and shifts
% every modelled phase. The ranges below are disjoint, so NO transposition
% of the three survives them: fc is a radar centre frequency (>= 1 MHz),
% eps_perp a permittivity of ice (> 1 but nowhere near 100), deps a small
% anisotropy (< 1). The fc floor is what closes the fc/eps_perp swap -
% (3.15, 750e6, 0.034) otherwise passes every check and returns a gpd1 some
% 1.5e10 times too small, a model with effectively no birefringence.
